<sect/ 1. KEY TO THE SYMBOLS

In the RESPELLING FOR PRONUNCIATION in the Dictionary, there is employed -- as shown in the Table -- a symbol for every clear vowel or diphthongal sound in the language; with, four instances, a pair of equivalents for the same sound as occurring in different situations, viz.: <b><udd/ = <oomac/ ; <usdot/ = <oocr/ ; <ocir/ = <add/ ;</b> and <b><ycr/</b> (final) <b>= <icr/ ;</b> besides <b><ait/</b> and <b><eit/</b>, italicized, as these vowels are in certain cases obscured and turned toward the neutral form; also, apostrophe for the voice-glide; and <b>N</b> to indicate foreign nasalized vowels; -- some of the sounds occurring only in accented and others only in unaccented syllables, and some others, with but slight difference of quality, in both; -- the <b><etil/</b> is always of the <ldquo/narrow<rdquo/ form in accented and the <ldquo/wide<rdquo/ in unaccented syllables. The <b><asl/, <esl/,</b> and <b><osl/</b> are used to represent the similar sounds in foreign words, but not limited as they are in English to unaccented syllables. The <b><usdot/</b> is employed, as the nearest English vowel we have, inexact as it is, to replace <b>u</b> French and <b><uum/</b> German; and in like manner the <b><etil/</b> for the <b>eu</b> French and <b><oum/</b> German.

The consonant letters <b>b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, p, r, t, v, w,</b> and <b>y,</b> and the digraphs <b>sh</b> and <b>ng</b>, are used with their ordinary normal value; <b>g, s, z,</b> and <b>ch</b> are each limited to a single sound; <b>n</b> and <b>th</b> are marked for one sound of each and used unmarked for the other. No use is made of <b>c, q, x,</b> or the digraphs <b>ph, gh, dg</b> and <b>wh</b>. The principal substitutions made with each consonant symbol in the respelling are noted in the Table.
