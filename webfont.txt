WEBSTER FONTS
=============

* Overview

This file describes special symbols and markup entities used in the GNU
Collaborative International Dictionary of English.

* Introduction

The special characters used in the electronic version of the Webster 1913
are required for visualizing unusual characters used in the etymology and
pronunciation fields of the dictionary, in a form comparable to the way they
appear in the original.

The GCIDE markup uses special markup entities.  Historically, "escape
sequences" were used to indicate the character's ordinal position in a
special font, prepared by MICRA, Inc. to represent it on screen.  Although
nowadays this method is obsolete.

Special markup entities are able to represent a wide range of characters.
A markup entity is similar to SGML one, but has a different format.  The
traditional &xx; format was judged inconvenient because the ampersand is
used frequently in the corpus.  Instead, GCIDE entities have the format
<WORD/, where "<" and "/" represent the beginning and end of the entity and
WORD represents the character itself.  Valid WORDs are in some cases
abbreviations (for compactness) of the ISO 8879 recommended symbols.

The Greek words appearing in the etymologies, when they are included, are
typed in a roman-letter transcription, which is described below in chapter
"Greek transliteration".

* Unrecognized characters

Wherever the typists did not know the character to use, they usually
inserted a reverse-video question mark.  This appears in full-ASCII versions
as <?/.  This mark was used both for characters in non-ASCII fonts, and for
unreadable characters (i.e., characters smeared in the original or distorted
in the copies available to the typists. The type in the original was in many
places smeared and illegible at the left and right page margins;
occasionally, small parts of words were blotted out by plain white space).

* Italics

In most places, italic font is represented by the tags <it>...</it>
surrounding the italic text, or by some other tag which also implies italic
font.  In the pronunciations, however, where italicized vowels are used
among non-italic and other special characters to indicate pronunciation, the
special codes <ait/, <eit/, <iit/, <oit/, <uit/, are also used to indicate
the italicized vowel.

* Diacritics

- Vowels with a circle above (as in Swedish) are coded <xring/ (x with a ring);
- vowels with tilde over them are represented by <xtil/ as in <etil/;
- letters with a dot above are represented by <xdot/;
- letters with a dot below are represented by <xsdot/ ("subdot");
- vowels with the "semi-long" mark are represented by <xsl/ ("semi-long" is
  a macron with a short perpendicular vertical stroke attached above);
- the circumflex vowels are represented as <xcir/;
- vowels with macrons above are <xmac/ (including <oomac/, the "oo" with an
  unbroken macron above the two letters, <aemac/ = the ligature ae with a
  macron);
- vowels with umlauts are represented by <xum/;
- vowels with a crescent (breve) above are represented by <xcr/;
- there is an occasional hacek or caron mark (an inverted circumflex) in the
  original; such letters are coded <xcar/.

Another special character used in pronunciations is an "n" with an underline
(like a macron, but below the letter), used to represent the "ng" sound.
This is coded <nsm/ ("n sub-macron").

The ligated th used in pronunciations to depict the "th" sound of "the" is
coded as <th/. Due to the lack of such a unicode character, this might be
replaced with a "th" with a double sub-macron.

NOTE: the letter combinations "fi" and "fl" are invariably printed as the
ligatures, but these ligatures are not marked as such in this transcription,
and the two letters are left as individuals.

* Special symbols

The dagger <dag/, double dagger <ddag/, and paragraph mark <para/ are rarely
used.

The symbols "greater than" and "less than" are encountered only once, and
are represented by <gt/ and <lt/ to not trip tag and entity parsing.

The schwa is symbolized by <schwa/.  It is not used in the pronunciations,
but is mentioned as a symbol.  The right-pointing arrow is <rarr/,
consistent with ISO 8879.

Two special entities <and/ and <or/ represent words "and" and "or" in
italics font.

* Symbol summary

Below is a complete list of the symbols used in the Webster, together with
their markup entity, and corresponding symbols in ISO 8879 and Tex coding.
Much of this table was prepared by Rik Faith, to whom we express our
appreciation.

The "Uc" column gives the Unicode representation of the character. A few
characters could not be represented using Unicode, such as:
- <asl/, <esl/ etc.: "semi-long" diacritics is supposed to have a macron
  with a short vertical bar in the middle. U+030D is the "right" combining
  character to use for achieving this (e.g. ā̍), but many fonts don't render
  it correctly. Thus, we used a middle dot above instead, which looks very
  similar.
- <th/: this denotes the "th" digraph having the horizontal line of t
  elongated to touch the letter h. This could not be represented in Unicode,
  as far as I tried. An alternative might be to have a double sub-macron
  below "th", as shown below.
- Apart from these, there are many other one-off differences.

The "nearest ASCII" equivalents are given for those who want to display the
data as best one can in 7-bit simple ASCII symbols without using the
"entity" symbols.

Comments:
  (1) The symbol in the "entity" column is the SGML-like symbol used in the
      present Webster files; the symbol in the "ISO 8879" column is the
      symbol for the same character given in "The user's guide to ISO 8879"
      by Smith and Stutely.

  (2) An asterisk "*" in the "entity" column means that this symbol and code
      value is not used in any form in GCIDE.

  (3) The heavy and light "accents" (<bacc/ and <lacc/), are never above a
      letter (these are not diacritical marks), but in-between letters, as
      the stress accent used in the headwords and pronunciations (" and `).
      The accent *follows* the syllable accented.

  (4) For some reason, the a breve and u breve have ISO codes (in the
      Latin-2 table), but the other vowels don't, in the Smith & Stutely
      book.  Is this a mistake?

  (7) Capital 'N' in pronunciations indicate "N in smallcaps", to represent
      the sound for the nasal N in French words.

  (8) Feel free to report any exceptions to these usage assertions.

                      This mark is used also for minutes of a degree, and for
                      "prime" to modify variables in mathematical expressions.
  184    b8     ”     <rdquo/ close double quotes (used with <ldquo/)
  186    ba     ‖     vertical double bar - represents the symbol used
                      in the printed dictionary before a headword to
                      signify that the word was adopted without
                      anglicization from a foreign language but in the
                      full-ASCII version this function uses \'d8 -- see 216

  196    c4     ―     graphic horizontal line
  195+208       –—    combination for a very long dash.  In the
                      original typing, the dash char 208 was used for
                      both non-breaking hyphen (in hyphenated words),
                      and for the em-dash used as an introductory mark
                      for various segments.  The em-dash should be
                      distinguished from the hyphen, but that
                      conversion hasn't yet been done.  In the full
                      ASCII version, a double hypen "--" represent the
                      m-dash.
  197    c5      t    first of a pair of characters (part 2: 231 e7)

                      - in some etymologies and pronunciation
  207    cf      ‐    short dash, used in hyphenated words, and in
                      breaking syllables where no accent is used. But
                      sometimes the typists used the normal hyphen
                      [45], or the long dash (decimal 208) for that
                      purpose.  The normal hyphen is the same length
                      as the long dash, but one pixel higher in the
                      character box.
                      # In headwords, in the full ASCII version, this
                      short dash is represented by the asterisk "*".
  208    d0      —    <mdash/ = represents the long dash, used for the em
                      dash which often precedes certain sections within a
                      definition, and which separates some sections,
                      such as wordforms or collocations within a
                      collocation segment.  This is replaced in the
                      full ASCII version by a double hyphen, "--".
  210    d2      œ    <oe/ = "oe" fused ligature
  211    d3      ō    <omac/ = o macron

                      circumflex) above
  214    d6      ǣ    <aemac/ = "ae" ligature with a macron
  216    d8      ‖    <par/ double vertical bar (short length; the long
                      length is the graphics character 186)
                      This precedes words marked with a double
                      vertical bar in the original dictionary,
                      signifying that the word was adopted directly
                      into English without modification of the spelling.
  220    dc      ŭ    <ucr/ = u with crescent above - used in some etymologies

  231    e7      h    second of a two-character combination (see part 1: 197)
  235    eb      ð    <edh/ = Old English and Icelandic "edh", (or "eth")
                      like a Greek delta with a hatch mark through
                      the ascender. Used to represent the
                      Anglo-Saxon/Icelandic/Gothic character, in
                      etymologies, pronounced like "th"
  237    ed      þ    <thorn/ "thorn", an Old English and Icelandic
                      character, appears like a "p" with an extended
                      ascender.
                      Used to represent the

  248    f8      °    <deg/ degrees (temperature or angle).  Note: some
                      typists used a superscript "o" to signify

* Greek transliteration

Stand-alone Greek letters are represented by entities <alpha/, <beta/,
<gamma/, <lambda/ etc.  Capitalized letters are <ALPHA/, etc.

Text appearing within the markers <grk></grk>, is a Greek transliteration
written in roman letters.  The following rules are used:

** Aspirants

Aspirants are represented by ' (apostrophe) and " (double quote) placed in
front of the letter modified.  Apostrophe stands for ψιλὸν πνεῦμα (ψιλή or
spiritus lenis), and double quote stands for δασὺ πνεῦμα (δασεία or spiritus
asper).

   'a  -- ἀ
   "a  -- ἁ

** Accents

Accents are placed after the accented letter.  The acute accent (ὀξεῖα) is
represented by ` (gravis).  The grave accent (βαρεῖα) is represented by ~
(tilde), and circumflex (περισπωμένη) is represented by circumflex.  Thus:

   a`  -- ά
   a~  -- ὰ
   a^  -- ᾶ

Some examples of the combined forms (aspirant + accent):

   'a` -- ἄ
   'a~ -- ἂ
   'a^ -- ἆ
   "a` -- ἄ
   "a~ -- ἂ
   "a~ -- ἃ

** Iota subscriptum

Iota subscript is represented by comma placed after the affected vowel.  If
the vowel is accented, the comma is placed after the accent mark.  For
example:

    a`,  --  ᾴ
    'a`, --  ᾄ

** Diaeresis

Diaeresis is represented by a colon immediately after the affected vowel.
If the vowel is accented, the accent is placed after the colon, e.g.:

    i:  --  ϊ
    i:^ --  ῗ
    i:` --  ῒ

** Letters

The table below shows, for each Greek letter, the corresponding markup
entity and transliteration.  The capitalized Greek letters are represented
by the capitalized versions of the letters shown here.

[1] "th" was used in some earier sections, but was changed due to potential
confusion with the tau+eta combination, as in λυτήριος
(<grk>lyth`rios</grk>, at "lyterian") or ποιητής (<grk>poihth`s</grk>, at
"maker").
[2] Final sigma is not distinguished here from middle sigma, but when
isolated, use <sigmat/ ("terminal sigma") for the final form.
[3] Both y and u are used interchangeably in this edition.
[4] "c" is always followed by "h", so the "h" component is not confusable
with eta.  Applications must first convert "ch" before converting "h", or at
least verify that an "h" to be converted has no preceding "c".
[5] This usage is theoretically confusable with pi-sigma, but that
[6] Archaic letter; only used once.

Roman "j" is unused.  Roman "u" is occasionally used instead of "y" to
represent upsilon.
